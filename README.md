# Gallery
As part of this project, I developed a program called Gallery that showed Flickr images in both a grid view and a map view. Additionally, it could click a picture to open its Flickr website in a web view. 

Moreover, it will have a map view that displays images on a globe based on the GPS information in those images. Additionally, a bottom navigation bar would be there with the ability to flip between the gallery and map views.
